# LeetCode + Rust

Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
Many years ago, I took part in **ICM ICPC** â€” a programming competition that had a big impact on how I think and code.  
Recently, I started missing that experience and wanted to bring back the fun of solving algorithmic problems â€” while
also preparing for coding interviews.

This time, Iâ€™m solving problems in **Rust** to level up my skills in systems programming and write safe, efficient code.

## Why LeetCode?

Solving coding problems is a great way to:

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Learn data structures and algorithms
- Explore Rust in real-world scenarios

## Why Rust?

Rust is a powerful systems programming language focused on safety and performance.  
I'm using it to:

- Practice ownership and borrowing
- Write fast and safe code
- Learn idiomatic Rust

## Folder Structure

Each folder contains a Rust module with a solution to a specific problem:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ problems/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ problem_53.rs
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ problem_66.rs
.....
â””â”€â”€ README.md

```

## How to Run

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then you can run all solution:

```bash
cargo test
```
